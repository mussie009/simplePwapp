# simplePwapp
React / Redux app. Lists all users from the API(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) (grid, listview). This will be the home page of the app. Has functionality to create a new user (user object in the API). Validations when creating a new user (validation error will be displayed to the user): Required fields: name, email, phone. Validated user data will be "posted" as a json object to the test API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts (this is a "fake" API that does not store data but will send you the data that you "posted" in return with an assigned ID). Created users are stored offline and can be accessed offline.
